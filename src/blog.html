            <p>“Women hold up half the sky. In supporting WISER, I am lending my small effort to uphold the arm, or shoulder, or heart of a hopeful young woman who lives far away as she is learning to hold up her part of the sky.”</p>

            <p>Becky Grantland first heard about WISER when her daughter, Liddy, lived on WISER’s campus for a summer as part of DukeEngage. A former English professor, and current school administrator, Becky resonated with WISER’s mission of education and empowerment: “education is freedom: educated women are able to transform their own lives and the lives of their children.”</p>
          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">
            <p>Liddy now works for WISER in communications and development, but that’s not why Becky gives to WISER monthly. “Every month, I give an allowance to my two college-aged daughters. By giving a gift every month to also to WISER, I know I am sharing with someone’s beloved daughter on another continent. And honestly, I feel that anyone’s daughter is my daughter, too.”<p></p>

            <p>Becky just gave her 31st recurring donation to WISER. For this lifelong educator, and mother of daughters, the choice to keep giving to WISER is simple. “How many of us now subscribe to periodic delivery of food or clothing right to our doorsteps? While we are automating these tasks for our convenience, I challenge you to automate a gift to WISER each month: $25, $50. Your monthly gift has the potential to change the world.”</p>

            <p>We couldn’t agree more. If you’d like to commit to a monthly donation in 2020, go to <a href="https://wisergirls.networkforgood.com/">https://wisergirls.networkforgood.com/</a>  and select “monthly” as your donation frequency.</p>

            <p>“My students see me as a role model. They believe that they can make it in life because I made it.”</p>

            <p>Gift Chalot spent her early days in Muhuru Bay primary schools, dreaming of a bright future but ever-aware of the challenges she would face in secondary school.</p>

            <p>Then came WISER.</p>
          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">
            <div class="row justify-content-center">

                <p class="pt-3 text-center">Gift teaches at Winjo <br>
                Secondary School.</p>
              </div>

            </div>  
            <p>Gift joined two friends—Lucy Gallus and Winnie Bellah—in one of the first graduating classes at WISER in 2014. At WISER, they found everything they needed to succeed. They each went on to university, a dream that had felt almost impossible only a few years before.</p>

            <p>Once they got to college, they faced an important decision: what would they study? For Gift and Winnie, the choice was easy. Education had changed their lives, and they would study education to change the lives of other students. Meanwhile, Lucy put her STEM skills to use, excelling at accounting.</p>

            <p>But when it was time for them to decide what to do with their university education, these three WISER alumni were drawn back to where they began.</p>

            <p>“I think it is good for WISER alumni to give back. We are supporting others so that they can rise up, the same way we rose up because of support from others,” said Winnie, who now teaches at Kumoni Primary School, just a few miles from WISER.</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/winnie.jpg" />
                <p class="pt-3 text-center">Winnie teaches at Kumoni<br>
                Secondary School.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Lucy could have taken an accounting job anywhere, but she chose instead not only to use her accounting skills in an educational context, but as the bursar at Winjo Seconday School in Muhuru Bay.</p>

            <p>“Because [our students] know our backgrounds, and now they see us working in their schools, they feel like it is possible for them.”</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/lucy.jpg" />
                <p class="pt-3 text-center">Lucy is the bursar at Winjo<br>
                Secondary School.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

           <p>In Muhuru Bay, WISER’s reputation precedes these alums: “There’s that pride of being WISER alumni. WISER is always at the top, academically, so when we’re teaching, [the community] believes that we’re just superb.”</p>

           <p>It’s hard to overstate the monumental shift these alumni represent. Just ten years ago, it was almost unimaginable to have more than one secondary-school graduate make it to university each year. Now, three highly sought-after university-graduates—who graduated from WISER in the same year—are supporting the next generation of students in Muhuru Bay.</p>

           <p>Winnie noticed the specific inspiration WISER alumni can share with their students and community: “Because people know that WISER is a good school—that they are empowering students with knowledge and skills—they are also interested in graduating and becoming teachers, like us. They see that we’ve gone through high school education, that we’ve worked through the challenges, and they want to learn how to overcome the challenges, too.”</p>

           <p>Flexing the problem-solving muscles that they honed at WISER, these alumni are noticing and responding to their community’s needs. Gift notes that what her students at Winjo need most are “more experienced teachers. The students need to be motivated and advised. Most of the students at Winjo, they come from humble backgrounds. They need motivation from people who understand them.”</p>

              </div>
            </div>


            <p>These three incredible alums prove what we WISER girls have demonstrated from the beginning: that when you educate young women, whole communities thrive. They show how WISER’s impact extends far beyond its classrooms, rippling out into classrooms across Muhuru Bay and the wider world. We could not be more proud to have these alumni in WISER’s network!</p>

            <h1 class="blog-heading">“We did this together:” WISER Celebrates the Class of 2019</h1>
            <p>It’s hard to remember a time when it was safe to gather in groups, to exchange hugs and well wishes, face-to-face. But in early March of this year, before the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, WISER’s campus was alive with celebration.</p> 

            <p>In honor of the class of 2019 – a class as remarkable and resilient as the classes before them and behind them – we couldn’t let their graduation go uncelebrated by our global community.</p>

            <p>The preparations for the festivities back in March began weeks in advance, as younger WISER students choreographed dances and readied the campus to receive nearly 200 visitors. When Graduation Day arrived, the girls were up early, practicing their moves and making last-minute touches around WISER.</p>
          <span class="dots">...</span>
          <span class="more">
            <p>As the Class of 2019 gathered at their alma mater to prepare for their ceremony, dressed to the nines and full of happy anticipation, they made time to catch up with each other, take photos, and, most importantly, have a quick dance party!</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/celebrate.jpeg" />
              </div>

                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/celebrate_two.jpeg" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>The ceremony began with the sounds of the marching band from the local boys’ secondary school as graduates, families, local supporters, students, and guests took their seats. Then began the speeches and music planned to honor the graduates, including a special dance by the Science and Engineering Club.</p>
            
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/dance.jpeg" />
              </div>
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/dance_two.jpeg" />
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>WISER supporters from Muhuru Bay filled nearly every seat, making the remarks of the community’s first ever female Chief, Chief Guest Flora, ring more true than ever: “This institution here in Muhuru does not just think about its own welfare. It is thinking about community welfare and keeping the power of the girl in mind. And I salute this mindset!”</p> 

            <p>The principal of Winjo Secondary School followed: “Education is power and WISER is the place that empowers girls. When you’re talking about the number of girls here who are changing industries all over the country, then you are talking about girls who change Muhuru and girls who will, indeed, change Kenya.” </p>

            <p>That much was clear from the lineup of alumni who spoke just before the graduates were announced. Young women who had sat in the same seats as the class of 2019, including WISER alum and WISER teacher, Everline, offered remarks to this incredible group of grads.</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/speech.jpeg" />
              </div>
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/speech_two.jpeg" />
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>Finally, it was time for the graduates to be announced. After all the years of study and preparation–the hours in extra tutoring sessions, the meals in the dining hall, the nervous moments before exams, the joy of accomplishing a goal that sometimes seemed far away–there is still nothing quite like hearing your name be called by Teacher Kennedy, and shaking Madame Dorcas’s hand.</p>
            
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/graduates.jpeg" />
              </div>
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/graduates_two.jpeg" />
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
             Madame Dorcas’s speech following the conferring of diplomas was poignant, and the WISER Class of 2019 waited to greet their families and friends as new graduates.</p> 

             <p>“Now I want to speak to the community – to thank you. Because we did this together, didn’t we? All of us here, every house in Muhuru, has supported WISER and has been shaped by WISER, too. Thank you for being part of this journey.”  
            </p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/host.jpeg" />
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Then came the moment that those Muhuru families had been waiting for since their students arrived at WISER as first-years in 2015. The crowd embraced the newest group of WISER alumni with hugs, kisses, and garlands galore!</p>
            
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/glitters.jpeg" />
              </div>
              <div class="col-12 col-md-6 py-3">
                <img alt="image title" class="img-fluid" src="/img/glitters_two.jpeg" />
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>As students and their families soaked in the joy of this moment, students reflected on what this moment means for their lives. “I am very proud of WISER,” said Esther. “It has made me be the person I am today. So I am very happy.”</p>

            <p>We are, too: happy that students had the chance to celebrate their graduate prior to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and happier, still, that this group of remarkable women, and the equally-remarkable community that raised them, will be leading our world into an uncertain future with poise, determination, and spirit.</p>
