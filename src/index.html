          <p> With common barriers like poverty, food
              insecurity, healthcare access, and psychosocial
              well-being mitigated, WISER unlocks girls’
              potential through exceptional academic
              instruction by local educators, enrichments in
              STEM, the arts, and athletics, and peer-to-peer
              and mentor led psychosocial support. </p>

          <p> WISER provides each and every one of its
              students with everything they need to succeed
              at school. And that means everything: from
              school supplies and menstrual hygiene
              products, to uniforms and three meals a day, all
              under a safe roof with caring adult mentors and
              educators.  </p>

          <h3 class="pt-4 pb-2" style="color: #707070;" > Every girl healthy </h3>
          <p> WISER’s “whole girl” approach to wellness
              recognizes that mental, physical, emotional, and
              sexual well-being are integrally linked and
              foundational to both individual and community
              success. That means WISER girls are not only
              healthy, they are champions of their own
              community’s well-being.  </p>

              <p class="text-center" >We believe in a future of women, imagining and building
                  technology that will mirror the people and societies for which they build. We seek to be a part
                  of the solution on a continent where youth constitute 37% of the working-age population but,
                  tragically, 60% of the unemployed. We provide practical, hands-on skills training that prepares
                  young women for existing opportunities in the labor market.</p>
