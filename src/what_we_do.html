        <h3 class="who_we_are">WGSS/EDUCATION</h3>
        <p> The WISER Girls Secondary School takes a holistic approach to the
          boarding school environment. Unlike other schools in the area, WISER
          provides everything a girl needs to be successful including — clothes,
          books, safe housing, female role models, leadership training, healthy food,
          mosquito nets, HIV education, and essential medicine.
          WISER is also committed to providing engaged and supportive teachers
          who live on campus. These role models spend time during the evenings
          and weekends empowering girls through competitive sports, academic
          clubs and competitions, career counselling, and academic tutoring. WISER
          is committed to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)
          education for girls and all students have access to a computer lab as well
          as two university-quality science labs.
          WISER builds an environment where girls excel. In fact, for the past three
          years, WISER has been ranked in the top 1% of the nearly 400 secondary
          schools in Migori County. </p>

        <h3 class="who_we_are">WATER</h3>
        <p> In partnership with UNICEF-WASH and the Government of Kenya,
          WISER built and maintains a clean water system that provides the only
          source of clean water for 5,000 members of the community. This water is
          dispensed via community kiosks run and managed by AIDS widows,
          providing much needed employment for this vulnerable population. </p>

        <h3 class="who_we_are"> SRH </h3>
        <p> Completely led by current students, WISER offers sexual and reproductive
          health training sessions to hundreds of youth in Muhuru Bay each year.
          These sessions take place in local primary schools and cover pregnancy
          and disease prevention, partner communication, menstrual hygiene, how
          to access and use contraceptive options, and more. Through these
          sessions, youth are equipped to better address their own health needs and
          the WISER girls leading the sessions learn valuable leadership skills while
          increasing the visibility of female </p>

        <h3 class="who_we_are"> COMMUNITY HEALTH/OUTREACH </h3>
        <p> Each year, WISER brings ear, eye, and gynecological healthcare
          providers to Muhuru Bay who offer free screenings to community
          members. To reduce the risk of HIV, WISER has partnered with Duke
          University to create the READY Program, which improves family
          communication skills and interactions to promote healthier lifestyles and
          mental well-being. The READY Program is implemented by community
          members at local churches and schools.</p>

        <h3 class="who_we_are"> PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT </h3>
        <p> Girls at WISER are sorted into “Houses of Wisdom” – peer-led guidance
          and counselling groups that meet weekly to discuss health, psychological
          challenges, or social issues in a safe environment. Teachers and
          administrators are assigned as mentors to the Houses of Wisdom and also
          to the different graduating classes in order to provide additional emotional
          support. WISER also offers one-on-one staff-led guidance and counselling
          sessions for all students. Twice a month, WISER girls meet as a school to
          discuss sexual and reproductive health issues with a teacher present to
          help guide conversation. </p>

        <h3 class="who_we_are"> STEM </h3>
        <p> While global and cultural stereotypes still exist surrounding women’s
          aptitude for STEM, WISER girls continue to exceed expectations and
          thrive in science and math. WISER’s science and engineering projects
          continue to win prizes at county and national levels. And for four years
          running, physics was among WISER students’ top-scoring subjects in
          their national exams.

          <p> WISER removes barriers standing between a girl and her health so that she can pursue her dreams without
            hesitation. All
            students at WISER receive sanitary pads, information about menstrual hygiene management, and comprehensive
            sexual
            and reproductive health training. WISER is committed to connecting girls with youth-friendly health services
            and since
            opening, WISER has had a 0% dropout rate due to early pregnancy. </p>
          <p>
            Girls at WISER also receive three balanced meals each day – often featuring food from our on-campus
            sustainable
            garden! Girls are given access to free HIV and TB screenings multiple times a year and essential medicines
            to treat
            malaria are available on-site.
