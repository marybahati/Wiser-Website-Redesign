          <p>
            In rural Kenya, education and health are intertwined for girls. Girls usually drop
            out of school due to pregnancy, child marriage, lacking sanitary pads, physical,
            sexual, and psychological abuse, or becoming AIDS orphans. Half of sexually
            active girls in the community have sex for money to pay for school fees, sanitary
            pads, or soap. This elevates their HIV risk and damages their mental health. The
            few girls who do complete secondary school often do so with low grades and
            cannot go to a university.
            Since our inception in 2007, WISER has provided the hardest-to-reach girls with
            the resources, healthcare, and education they need to overcome poverty and
            gender inequity. WISER now serves 240 girls who are change-makers for their
            families and community, achieving unprecedented outcomes and laying
            foundations for ever-brighter futures.
